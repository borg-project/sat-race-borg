BORG-SAT-10.04.30
=================

COMPILATION
-----------

From the `src` directory, run `make`. The build process requires recent
versions of gcc, cmake, Python, and boost. Note that `src/Makefile` is only a
thin wrapper around the richer, cmake-based build system which the
`src/dep/cargo/run_cmake` script will populate under `src/dep/cargo/build`.

USAGE
-----

The script "solver" is an entry point to various modules. To solve a SAT
instance, use:

`solver utexas.tools.portfolio.solve -v -m ext/dcm_model.pickle --seed <RANDOMSEED> <path/to/instance>`

For additional usage information on this portfolio solver, use:

`solver utexas.tools.portfolio.solve --help`
