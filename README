COMPILATION
-----------

From the `src` directory, run `make`. Note that `src/Makefile` is only a thin
wrapper around the richer, cmake-based build system which the
`src/dep/cargo/run_cmake` script will populate under `src/dep/cargo/build`.
The build process requires recent versions of at least:

* gcc
* boost
* cmake
* GSL
* Python
* numpy

This package may include some or all of these dependencies installed under
`ext/prefix`. The solver scripts appropriately set the relevant environment
variables.

USAGE
-----

The script "solver" is an entry point to various modules. To solve a SAT
instance, use:

`./solver utexas.tools.portfolio.solve -v -m ext/dcm_model.pickle --seed <RANDOMSEED> <path/to/instance>`

For additional usage information on this portfolio solver, use:

`./solver utexas.tools.portfolio.solve --help`

To calculate the machine performance calibration score, do:

`./solver utexas.tools.calibrate -c ext/calibration.json`

SUBSOLVERS
----------

This portfolio solver would not be possible without the immense amount of work
done by many other people to create the subsolvers it employs. This release
includes:

* clasp (Martin Gebser, Benjamin Kaufmann, and Torsten Schaub)
